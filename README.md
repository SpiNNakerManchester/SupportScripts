These are our support script we use to develop the [SpiNNaker Project](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/)

They are intended for our internal use only and have only been tested in as far as they work for us on our machine when we are running it.

Use of these scripts is therefore completely at your own risk and you must verify they do what you want before running them.


Type of Scripts found here
==========================
None of the scripts here are required for end users or end user deployment.

They are also not required for developer deployment but may make some development tasks easier.

There may be scripts here used by [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/SpiNNakerManchester) but only if they are purely used for things like code verifiaction and sanity checking.

Usage
=====

In general these script will assume that you have installed all the main SpiNNaker repositoires in parellel. (Ie all under the same directory)
